# Substitution Management System

My IA is a tool for teachers to request substitutions, with an admin interface for efficient management. Clear notifications should be sent promptly. The focus is on simplicity and transparent communication.

## Rationale for Proposed Product

Development will focus on a user-friendly website using Java and SQL for a robust solution. The interface prioritizes simplicity for substitution requests and notifications.

## Success Criteria

- Secure teacher login.
- Submission of requests through the system.
- Admin interface for efficient management.
- Immediate and clear notifications.
- Database for substitution requests and teacher timetables.
- Automated reminders.
- Integration with the school timetable.
- Algorithm suggesting substitutes.
- Archive of past requests and outcomes.

## Implementation Ideas

- No substitution if most classes are occupied.
- Substitution based on subject and grade.
- Database for absent teachers to provide instructions.
- Messages for absent teachers.
- Half-day substitutions.
